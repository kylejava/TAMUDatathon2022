## Inspiration
I want to get into Data Science, and thought that this hackathon would be a great opportunity to create a beginner project. I was looking through various resources and trying to find different datasets that would help me get a better idea on what to create. I found a file that contained a bunch of spam messages and non-spam messages and decided to build a classier around it.

## What it does
Simply detects whether a message is spam or not.

## How we built it
The tools used were Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, & NLTK.

## Challenges we ran into
Considering this is my first Data Science project I wasn't really sure where to start, I looked up a bunch of different tutorials and documentation, and tried to find any resources.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a model that uses the Support Vector Machine, it was my first time using that learning method.

## What we learned
Many different tools and topics of Data Science & Machine Learning

## What's next for Spam Detector
Building a UI for it.
